# Random-Password-Generator

## Java-script Random password generator

Using the HTML & CSS files that were provided. I coded the logic using javascript to provide functionality to the random generator tool. When the user clicks the "Generate PAssword" button, then the user is prompted the following questions. How many characters between 8-128 does the user want to set for the password length. Does the user want to add uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and/or special charcters for the password criteria. The user must select atleast one of the options. Once all the choices have been made by the user then, all selected information is processed to produce a random index out of those selections. The random index results will be registered and returned back to the user as the new random password.
